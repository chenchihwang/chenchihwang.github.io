1st journal post!! kinda exciting no cap! today was pretty mid. tough gym sesh, felt like the weights weren't moving but that's ok. happens. spent the rest of the day figuring out how to clone and host a website. took 5 hrs ish. coulda been done faster but thats ok. it was pretty fufilling so thats good. 

Need to get some actual work done tmrw.

hopefully it'll be written in this journal that its gotten done. ig this is just something that can keep me on track!

Gonna be writing these journal entries daily so i can look back on what ive done and feel the progress more concretely. Also for mental copium so I don't actually lose it.

day 1, freshman, second semester, in midterm week
