woke up late, did nothing till like 6 ish which felt rly awful. I really need to get good sleep to operate like a real human being. took a nap, felt like a real human being after that, finished 150, went to the gym, started CGA and will prolly try to finish tonight, had really fulfilling hangout with friends so that was good!

gonna go to sleep and lock in tmrw !

i feel like im taking my weekends way less srsly than I am last sem and that feels kinda off. idk why that is or if its actually true!
