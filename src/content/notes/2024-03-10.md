last day of break, did some good-ish work on CPS, but honestly not completely fulfilled, thats ok tho gonna lock in tmrw and finish the majority of it, or at least get enough insights into finishing everything

pretty much just worked the whole day. had fun hangout with friends near the end of the day but ig it just feels still unfulfilling when we afk and do nothing. might be a toxic trait i have that i want every moment to be 100 but thats never going to be possible.

all g

finally the break is over, i cant wait to finally feel the fear of god himself looming over me, his watchful eye keeping me on track as i finally get all the shit i need done done. itll be good to finally feel the pressure again

i realized i just cant work during the break, and i feel that because of that i dislike myself slightly more. yeah i just hate who i am during the break. ig its just cuz i cant get anything done, cuz i cant lock in, not even for like lack of effort but i just dont feel the fear so like i cant actually get it done. idk

gonna start journalling more frequently cuz things are picking up - better document these days to make sure i feel like im moving forward, or at least figure out if im not.
