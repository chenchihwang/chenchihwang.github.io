not sure why i dont have a journal entry for yesterday, guess i was too busy. This entire week back from the break ive been pretty locked in. tryna burn myself as far as i can go. see how brightly i can shine type shit. idk. today has been the same

i worked pretty ok-ish hard throughout the day. woke up 20 min late but thats ok. still working on it. tried my best thru lab and thru the rest of the day. felt like i was completing most of the shit off my checklist. still have all of malloc to go through but its alright ill jsut do my best tomorrow - all of tomorrow i think i will spend on malloc . we'll see how burnt out i get !

i got a little mad at samee and milen today which i regret. its def mb cuz theyve been thru a lot of shit today and i shouldnt be getting mad just cuz .... welp its whatever. its def a little bit all of our fault but i feel bad so ill apologize tmrw!!

i was feeling down tn cuz i think the grind was getting to me a little bit. jsut the whole day and still the stress of more to do. but near the end of today i was talkign to anthony for a rly good bit so it was quite mentally relieving!! that was a definite up of the day !

also i got my contract today finally which im quite excited for. we'll see exaclty how much money  ill have to pay in tax tmrw morning!

ok, off till the next one (which could be tmrw or the week after LMFAO)
