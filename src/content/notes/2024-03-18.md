rly rly tough day today

these days come .

i was wondering today if i break down too easy. if its somethign that i do too much. why im so emotional at the end of the day and other ppl can tank this shit. and deal with it like nothing evenhappened. 

idk bro . 

maybe it comes from the way i was raised. and when you deal with that much bs then you sorta 
jsut take the L on that day. cry your heart out . and then move on the next day. 

liek surely im this way because ive been trained up to be this way right. and if ive been trained up to this point then it has to work for somethign right. so it has to be right tech ? surely . 

nah i wonder why this happens . ive gotten bitch bitched like 3 times here alr. idk if thats a low number or a high numebr but i feel liek thats kidna frequent. 

maybe its that i cant brush it off like how i see others do. so i have to take the L and cry to like try and allieviate the difference bteween us. liek maybe if i dont break down ill just get cooked omega. liek i just have a debuff idk .

its tough tho. i needed to start this lab earlier. i already knew i cant code well. if i knew that i shoulda started earlier to at least lvel the playign field . this is just me takign the L for my sins. its okay i learned my lesson. 

also think i may be burning out but i cant tell yet

we'll see how things progress.
