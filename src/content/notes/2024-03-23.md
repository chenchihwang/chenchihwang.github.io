need to journal tonight - lots of thoughts going thru my head. ive been blurry hazy and just plain burnt out for the past little bit. all for things i realize are prolly inconsequential. grinding classes away, the wicker of my soul burning ever lower and lower weaker and weaker for what

a fkign grade ?? 

what is wrong with me bro ... i need to lock in focus on the things that matter to me. need more time to hang out with friends. need to allocate more me time. as much as i want to believe im a machine im not bro.

finally soted out my inner thoughts and now im more convinced that im actually a good person. it seems this is somethign quite important to me acutatlly now tha ti think about it. it was disturbing me how much i was scared i might actually not be a good person. 

i realized its just a matter of context. how much ppl know about me dictates how they wanna judge me. and well thats chill too makes sense honestly. its on me how much i share anyways right so rly its like .. on me. 


yeah whatever 

finally clear head these days. time to lock in especially hard. think ill try tmrw and see my mental state after!
