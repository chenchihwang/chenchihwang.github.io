had a chance to do the cooldown routine today. overall good day tho nothing much happened

got to thinking about what i believe. i think as long as I remain convinced and no one can convince me otherwise, ill have good ideology. and as long as my ideologies remain true when compared against each and every other ideology, ill have reached transcendence or sm like that.

did some more research for AI within autism and that got me pretty excited about the potential.

gonna keep on thinking and play some more chess games to cool down. maybe do a leetcode. before i sleep. hit the wordle and connections for today. gonna go bike tomorrow and weigh my options on which gym i end up choosing.
