small entry before sleeping, if i can do that everyday will prolly be good for my mental. 

spent my last day with parents, time to adult it up myself ykwim

cooked a little with father today, lotta food in the fridge, hopefully i got the skills to pay the bills and keep myself fed. did hella dishes today. felt like i was overall pr productive.

good stuff i feel .

looked over classes stuff a little, looks to be pr scary and pr exciting at the same time. 

gotta lock in . i wanna be out more too tbh, meet more ppl.

got to meet the homie chloe today, that was pr fun!
