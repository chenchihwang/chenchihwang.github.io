late journal entry coming in, sitting in ai gen ed ethics class rn 

this day felt pr good. did all my work, there wasnt that much work to be done on the first day, but i finished all of it so it felt pr good. 

the sole and only problem was how late i slept and how negatively that can affect the next day. 
gonna start gymming grind to try and mitigate that remaining awakeness as much as possible. will probably need to cook soon as well. will also need to think about not napping too much even when exhausted. also looking to wake up wayy earlier at like 7, so i can take care for breakfast, or just get to campus earlier. 

also looking for meal blocks. if theres anyone reading this believing in feeding the hungry, reach out to me !
