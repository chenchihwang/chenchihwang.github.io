decent day today, met with a lot of friends, attended a reci that wasnt being held but otherwise was pretty smooth . i i also tried to reheat some food and idk if it worked but like i dont think so ... all g tho . 

did work on the 281 codign assignment a little bit. things are gonna get really hard really quickyl i imagine. might be worth reviewing integration tools, might be worth reviewing clive book. 

again need to work on the sleep stuff, might want to set bedtime to 10 pm so i can actually wake up at normal times. will try to eat at 8 and then look to do some cooldown, as well a journal tmrw.

note that these prev school days were incredibly light.

will hit the gym again tmrw
