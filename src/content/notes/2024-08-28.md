finally doing a journal on time, today was good insanely tiring but i managed to stay all day on campus. maybe i was so tired bcz i didnt have dinner until much later. 

hit the gym and had a big din din. need to pick up groceries and do laundry but planning for that to be done over the weekend.

also worked on my resume a little bit today, feels good. im liking how its turning out. tmrw it should be sufficiently done. 

gonna be able to sleep for nine hours tonight which im very excited about 
tmrw will be super hard as well with many consecutive classes, so gotta make sure i have enough sleep

today just felt hard cuz i had to stay on campus from 9 to 8 essentially. almost a 9 to 9 ... 

just like work fr !
