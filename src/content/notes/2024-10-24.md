tired as hell in the morning, barely able to get anything out of classes in the morning. 

highly inefficient, dont wanna stay up that late anymore at all. 

i want to start waking up at 7 am each day if possible, we shall see if that works out

goofy ass story wrt. to groceries today, gained a lot from it i think.

writing from oct 25:
rly bad day, slept late and didnt adhere to my principles, it was a bit warm in my room making ithard to slepe. i just didnt sleep. ah fk its so bad. i need to wake up early and go to sleep exhausted. i imagine if i kept studying i would have got in like 3 hrs of good studying before passing out. 

- made the start to 10/25
