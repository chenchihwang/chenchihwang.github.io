## journal

writing a bit in the morning, hoping for a good grind day...

i just realized something i think i wanted to note down tho. i think i have a strong desire to try out the different varieties of america's fast foods. not like its a criteria for being american, just somethign i think i didnt have the chance to try as a kid. no money no food no agency. so its somethign that i think ive wanted for a while. 

maybe when i go vanlifeing across the US, ill hit all the fastfoods and try them at least once. i think taco bell was quite yummy i wanna try them more ! kinda expensive tho !

pr out of it for the whole day, wasnt able to get much rly rly productive work done, felt like i coulda got what i did yst done in like half a day instead of the entire day...
