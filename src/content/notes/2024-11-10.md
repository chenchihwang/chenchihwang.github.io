## journal

uh invested some time into van life, i think im still weighing my options behind a small crib vs idk a nicer larger one. the extra mobility is rly nice i think, but i also want the comfort pr badly....

i think i wanna prioritize the comfort more tho ... + with larger van i can build out more features... i think i want two sliding doors, and windows maybe all around ? and def a skylight, + fan for ventilation + still adequate room for solar to charge various things.

overall okay day but i need to take better more optimal breaks (not rotting and isntead thinking about van life) and context switch between variou things to remain super optimal, plus i feel like i should be getting more sleep.
