thinking about courses:
dont think i wanna take 10701 this sem
will leave 315 for next sem?

10-301 - intro ml for non SCS majors
- need to make sure i can get credit for htis
- see if i can take this with schedule conflicts with 36-226

11-492 - speech technology for conversational AI
- need 15210 prereq (will email prof to see if i can coreq it)

11-711 - phd nlp
- prolly insanely legit
#### scs electives: 

15-330 - computer security  
- prolly pr interesting

15-294 + 15-394
- make sure these count for extra scs elective...
