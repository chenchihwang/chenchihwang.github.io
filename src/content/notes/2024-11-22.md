no gym today, also want to invest more time into MMA, i think i get a lot of fulfillment outta it. super hard stuff willing to spend way more time and get good at it. its like a game but irl LMFAO. im tryna climb the academic and physical ladder.

i need to cut my bangs for mma, thats how hard i want to all in

worked myself physcially, but not mentally. even when i go this hard its still pr hard to go to sleep early.

woke up late, but im tryna regain back my life.

went to sleep late, idk what i was doing... genuinely dk how to fix this part of me...
