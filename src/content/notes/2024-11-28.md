saw the homie sungah yesterday, it was pr fun. im gonna need to lock in hella today. 
starting the grind at 1 pm today.

i woke up at around 1030 and rotted teh mornign away which was lowk so bad. also reorganizing journal and sending out `who im willing to kill` on the blog today to thoroughly convince myself 

also pausing exploration + talking to ppl for the break for teh sole goal of catching up over the break
