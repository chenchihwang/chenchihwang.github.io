super great talk with hadrien, opened my eyes to the EU work culture, maybe a great place to settle down idk. seems like a very interesting place.

super great friendsgiving celebrating anthony's birthday type shit. was super great. i realize that hard work buys you back time. enjoying the hard work buys you freedom and lifts a weight off your chest.

had a fun day, next two days are work daysaa
