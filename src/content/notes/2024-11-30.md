woke up at like 9-ish and it was too early, i was def not functioning properly. idk why ive been needing so much sleep recently

took a nap from like 12-3, only able to start doing real work after that

man i wasted the night, i think i learned that if i dont work out or do anything to strenous or stimulating (like talkign to ppl or whatever) and do work in room all day then i dont / wont get gassed out that hard so i can afford to sleep less i think is what the consensus is.
