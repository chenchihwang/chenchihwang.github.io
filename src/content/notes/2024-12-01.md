woke up at like 12, with like 7 hrs of sleep - feeling pr good and not that tired. think ill skip gymming for the rest of the semester so i can focus up. its like 10 more days and i have a decent amt of stuff i need to lock in on.

itll give me more time back to work on just school - no gym + less sleep.

passed out at like 9 ish slept for like 3 hrs till 12 ... need to figure out what is going on with my sleep asap before i get proper screwed.

also i had a grave realization today. im not one of the goats. not even close. the goats always push on no fear, no loss of motivation or sm idk . like today i realized im just not technical. as a cs major being non technical, this is pr illegal. i need to lock tf in. 

i have so much more potential
