went to sleep pr late last night too, today is a pure lock in day no excuses no stopping. i need to clutch up and now im feeling the heat ...


 was tryna think of projects to work on over the break , and spend too long doign that i fear. came up with `growth grove` or `gardener's growth grove` or `the gardening grove`, still working on the name i need to write down the idea before i forget...

 slept on time today! just woke up super late cuz my body needed it from working out so hard
