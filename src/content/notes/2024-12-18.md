got home last night, so happy to be back. noticed everytime i go back my parents are getitng more and more senile. i think it happens inversely proportionally, like the more independent i get the more they regress, because its far less responsibilty for them now to take care of me so its good that they can take it easily mentally. 

still dk how good it is tho...

like its kinda scary to see them like this tbh!
