rotted the morning away, im act in such a good position to work hard today. still reflecting on yesterday and not sure how i feel about yst. what am i frustrated by? wasting my time shopping? weak people ? weakness? people?  uninteresting people? things that dont bring value to me?

probably the last one. hrm. to make friends i have to assume nobody can bring me any value. assume that they cannot and will not. when they do i can be pleasantly surprised but always assume they will not. never let my expectations be raised. 

additionally note that people in easy situations will remain weak. as i am right now im weak too.

im act disgusting. many things abt my personality i wanna change. not that i will enjoy the presence of all people, i just want to face it better.
