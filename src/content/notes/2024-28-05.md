am i stupid for thinking i would journal everyday ??
what is wrong with me.

dont promise things i cant fulfill on ...


anyways journal time - 
today was a good day 
good day at work, felt like decent productivity, decent work hours and i think im not gonna spend too much time working at home today.

worked on the website a little bit, did a little updating. added CV section, somethign ive been meanign to do forever to be honest

happiness is such a fickle thing. yesterday was pr rough and i was wondering why i was so somber but i realize inherently im just lonely dawg. HAHA. harder to realize cuz ive been alone forever but sm like that. and that lead to a lot of thinking about how to be happy. i got a rly good conversation in with justin so that was rly good.

its crazy how bipolar it is tho
some days are so good
some days are so mid they jsut feel bad even tho nothign bad happpend ? 
some days are good.

how strange.

i wonder if thats just the human condition.

i think i wanna read more . consume less brainrot. and then write more. it'd be really cool if i had a section here on the website that was less rambling and some good ass writing. writing that made anyone feel anything. I think that'd be really cool to put raw emotion good into words good enough to make anyone feel anythign. 

ok shorter journal today but im pr tired from work alr. gonna call it here and gonna try and scroll less insta in the future! reading more is fs the play!
