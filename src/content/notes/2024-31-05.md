i think im getting into good schedule. not sure tho. 
i think the tech is to cool down with skincare -> couple chess games -> journal -> reading -> sleep
thats a lotta cooldown tho. had hella trouble sleeping yesterday so i wanna get more tired these days so it comes easier. but i imagine if i do more physical shit and get exhausted the cooldown routine is gonna get cooked. we'll see how long i can manage it.

realized above all else i need bike so i can get to exploring even when others are working !
