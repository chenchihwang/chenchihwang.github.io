schools back, wanted to do a quick entry here. break ended, and it was the longest break i ever felt. lots of things i wanted to do that i didnt get to. in a weird way my brain has allocated laziness with my home. i wonder how weird that is or how weird that is not. 

overall its okay, its not the worst thing that could happen. i breaked during the break. like thats all that happened. and its not like that shouldnt happen that defeats the purpose of the break. 

no regrets just disappointed in myself.

but ill work to fix those this sem. i have a lot of hopes for this sem. so much so that i was hoping for move in date quicker and quicker, just so i could be able to get back to work and to gain back my own autonomy and agency. 

i dont like new years resolutions as that seems to pose that self improvement can only happen once a year as if its a special occasion but one thing i would like to change that i conveniently realized this break was: i want to lose ego. 

ego is something that i value pr highly, i imagine its important for sure. but in a way it stops me from reaching my fullest. I feel that there should be things i know already and then ... when it comes for me to study them, like transformers, i feel that i might get judged for learning them only now. its chill tho. with no ego comes no shame.

thats one thing i would like to work on this sem!
