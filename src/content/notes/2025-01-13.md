woke tf up this morning, will need to take a nap later got maybe ~6 hrs of sleep. looking forward to locking in today and getting into a good schedule.

couldnt take a nap when i needed to. the importance of good sleep to me is so crucial as it affects my interactions and thus my relationships and eveyrhting else. there is certainly a snowball effect...

insanely productive day otherwise tho - went to , worked out, had my first acai bowl, went window shopping for thrifting, did groceries, cooked with justin and emily, and meal prepped and finished all my hmwrk, just didnt learn today but thats ok. more learning to be done whenever!
