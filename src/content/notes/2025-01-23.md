# journal

had interesting talk with amelia last nigth abt societal problems, i think i overall had a conversation that was more productive than the alternative, prolly woulda played tft, i also do not know how useful it was in general but it did make my happy so thats prolly whats most important.

also had great talk with the FIT team, the homie prof begel is pr sharp!

felt like i did a lot today but also not that much at all.

justin may be leaving soon... and minjune has alr left. bro idek what to feel rn. i act need to work harder...

im also worried im spreading myself too thin. all the things im generally interested in are : 
- AI safety, 
- blockchain 
- MMA fs, 
- and i also wanna build applications for those with special needs. 
- i also wanna build tools related to transformers...

bro ...
