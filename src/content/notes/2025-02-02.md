i slept wayy too mucht today, i realized it comes down to willpower to get up earlier - not anything else. i just gotta do it cuz theres things to get done that day.

also had another thought about religion. relates to waht amelia was saying. there can be no "correct" philosophy or thuoght process. the moment you get into that thinking, sm rly bad happens becuase you dont consider the grey areas. then in that case is religion or christianity scary ? yes in the way that they set in stone some absolute correct moral philosophy imo. but to believe in christianity, you need to be believing absolutelty in this moral philosophy so does that mean the most devoute and correct christians will then be the least open minded, and the open minded christians are not good chrsitians ?

i really want to be getting used to reading journals / articles / news when im eating - thats a good point
