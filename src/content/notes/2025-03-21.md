thought abt the future for a bit, when i begin applying like a madman ill apply to co-ops for sure. if i get in any then, ill figure out what i do, but for now dont think so much and just apply.

i want to study abroad my last year if posssible. looks like ill finish most of my cs core by end of junior year, most of senior year will be gen eds i believe. at that time ideally im studying abroad and just applying to full time roles
