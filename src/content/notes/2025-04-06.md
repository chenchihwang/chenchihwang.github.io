- check from exploration checklist when i have time
##### menial:
- need to talk with justin
	- tell justin im considering going to a studio apt
	- **if i stay** i need to sort out details on this property
		1. if prakash + friends dont cough up money for the summer then we each need to pay 900
			1. if concerned about this we should do more posting for summer spots and find "more reliabile" people
			2. or just collect deposits + write up contracts + take ids 
		2. also need thsee guys to pay utils as well...
		3. and like if shit gets dirty we need to pay clean up fee ?
		
	- if justin is gauranteed to pay throughout the summer and thru the next term as well, then he should sign the lease as well for the next term. this means ytou promise to pay from like now (may 2025 - aug 2026), or find a new roomie
	- also leaves the question of what to do with furniture
	
	- ideally you do a post so i can leverage a wider network for "good" roommates that can fill the last spot 
	- and ill need to keep looking for roommates as well
	
	- **if i leave**, then im not coming back in aug
		- ill need to communicate with justin + minjiune + landlords ( cr kelly)
		- w justin i need to know how much trouble this will be for you
			- and like where he would stay next sem.. 
			- ig it would be likely that he will dip from this spot too?
		- w minjune i would ideally liek to pass of teh responsibility of the prakash mfkers onto him as well
		- and with landlords maybe we can communicate to shorten minjunes term to end in may so that we all dont have to deal with it
		- then i just need to find a single studio
		- or live with some other peeps
	
- need to look for roommates 
- check from menial checklist when i have time
