wrote up my personal intro to the team here:

Hey team!

My name is Chen and I'm currently doing my 2nd year undergraduate at CMU for CS. 

I was here last summer working with Huron to gather metrics for our compaction function and I loved my time here a lot! The team was so great to me. I'm back here for this summer as well and I'm looking forward to working with you all again!

My latest interests are HCI and AI safety and my personal hobbies include cycling, and BJJ. 

If you see me, feel free to walk up to me and chat - I love meeting new people!
