- upload nn from scratch to github + website
##### menial exploration

learn git first 

need to debug why website isnt updating

website update:
- update proj with nn from scrawtch and github link
- update now, about, cv (with research), timeline (road trip event, second first day at amazon), inspiration (frankle), reads (), colophon (The tools and services powering chenchi.**tech**), goals (drive across teh country, get research with lab that is quite cracked, get into assets or any major conference, get technical), projects (sdlinear shit - implemented[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06942](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06942 "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06942") paper ), neural net from scratch 

push linter into github

resume update
- classes
- projects
	- put speech tech proj

add projects from :
- neural comp, 
- 210
- speech tech
	- combine the below:

list of notes of things i did last semester :

- classes:
	- cs + discrete math course
	- algorithms
	- rl
	- various math courses
	- various other courses for exploration
		- SPEECH TECH CONVO AI
		- NEURAL COMPUTATION
		- cog pysch

- research:
	- Bridged the double empathy gap in mixed neurotype conversations by building a personalized machine learning model to convey the meaning of your physical mannerisms.
		- read lot of papers on speech reciprocity
		- pitch mimic, behavioru mimic
		- autism dont match pitch
	
- projects:
	- secureAI
		- developed web app that demonstrated nanogcg 
			- iterative approach to nudge llms towards a "sure, here is how to " response
			- abuses the stochastic nature of llms
		- and a novel counter
			- pipe response into another llm
				- known as llm chaining or similar to a chain of thought approach, but we didnt know about htat hyet at the time
		- won vthacks 
	- developed a novel method to prevent code switching in spoken dialogue systems 
	- built out full spoken dialogue system relatively from scratch
	- built a nn from scratch


overall this last year strengthend my theory side a lot, whereas my implementation side i feel, lacks a little. so what im most excited for is to grow that weakness and turn it into a strength this summer.
