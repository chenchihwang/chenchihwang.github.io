feeling the worst ive ever felt abt myself, but it only appears when other ppl be around. in a vacuum im fine. this is the most dangerous thing. it enables recursive isolationism. i gotta focus for a bit in isolation so i can be fine w others again. jeez this is bad.

even if isolated, set up measures to feel connected constantly. i need to scroll linkedin in the mornings right as i wake up. and journal when i go to sleep. give myself 1 hr in the morning before im fully going, and aroudn 2 hrs at night so i can journal properly, get sleepy, and also do leetcode and apply to things.
