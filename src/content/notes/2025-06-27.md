i read this nice thing on substack that says thinking about doing x is not the same as doing x. this is obviously true but our brain can conflate these two so easily. also read sm about quantity vs quality wrt. photography. grinding quality means you know theory, but you need to grind quantity to get good results.  

got rejected by arena today. thats fine i was a poor applicant, but still feels bad. quantity tho right? gotta grind thru hella rejections to get accepted. part of the journey

i also may never be a good cook, i care too little about food. i think its good aura play tho. mma is also good aura play.
