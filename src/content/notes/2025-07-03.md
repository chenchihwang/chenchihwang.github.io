the internet and what it brings gives similar vibes to the agricultural revolution. also in my experience i shouldn't write about who i want to be, that just defeats the purpose. instead of giving myself direction i put myself in the spot i wnat to be in my head. then shit never gets done. just work first and retrospect later i think is most optimal.
