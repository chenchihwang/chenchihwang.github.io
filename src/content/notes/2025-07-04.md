worked on website all day. genuinely felt like a pr poor day because i didnt feel like much happened. low progress even though i was working all day. i think that comes with like working with new tools, new frameworks and just not really knowing what im doing. 

i think this comes everytime i try and do something new and i shouldnt set unnecessarily super high expectations for myself just beginning. what does that mean tho? work at my own pace and dont get overwhelmed. at the same time try to deeply understand what it is im doing. what im doing right now is just vibe coding which isn't really productive. i should be doing this proj firstly to learn, secondly to create what is loved.

, need to write tomorrow. start like 3 threads:

- limbo
	- 
- bitter-ness
	- no friends
	- talk about energy
- meaning
	- create what ppl love
