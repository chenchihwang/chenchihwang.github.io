did the following writings (should go live soon if not today):
- meaning
	- create what ppl love

still need to do these:
- limbo
	- 
- bitter-ness
	- no friends
	- talk about energy

writing feels pretty good imo. its a pretty low energy way to still feel productive. i do want to produce good writing tho, so lets see how i tune it. its an intersting paradigm actually. with so much ai slop thats being fed out it might seem coutner intuitive to add to the existing text. i think its still pretty cool though and its nice how there are still various methods to find continuously good text whether thats from substack or other forums. 

some of this text is super inspiring as well , and i think some of my experiences are no less valid, so i hope to begin write something inspirational as well.

i also rotted unproductively for like the better part of the morning. -4 hours that way. cannot be rotting like that. cannot be feeling like its ok to rot like that and cannot let the people around me influence me into thinking thats ok. at the very least always be learning something. i also didnt gain that much enjoyment from rotting like that so, good heuristic that is prolly not what i should be doing.

had decent evening just didnt work on the website at all. just cooked and chilled. lowkey pr poor. i need to get out of the house wayy more.
