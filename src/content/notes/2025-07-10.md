super poor sleep, this has actually been killing me. lets work hard get my chores done get my work **work** done then work on website and sleep ealry today. i need it so bad. 

also im breaking out in hives from stress... 

also realized i used this journal half like twitter as well? half like an actual journal so thats good. i think truly having nobody around me is eating me up. its actually truly quite poor. i want to write more about this. i am conflicted because i both 
- want to lock in fully like matthew is: 
	- secure these good opportunities (even though ik he is not fully locked in and working 24/7. he def still talks to buddies),
- and also take it easy, hang with cool ppl and not stress too much about work and opportunity.

im lost at an impasse as option 2 is something people no longer think i want. friends think im tryna lock in and they also think i dont want them prolly. so when i reach out they dont even wanna yap. i need - in my head - to register as like i got no homies. then there's no internal strife and pain when they arent there for me. this is the most logical choice i feel.

may do more writing later tonight to word this better.
