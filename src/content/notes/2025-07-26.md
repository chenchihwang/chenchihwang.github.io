the ebbs and flows of my life are crazy. sometimes the downs feel so down. sometimes im so lethargic and so goddamn lazy. its because of this that my self actualization and my own sense of self is so poor. i ... i dont really know what to do. i dont think the people closest to me understand how lazy i am. its really quite poor, eats me up. kills me. 

i fear my own mediocrity more than anything.
