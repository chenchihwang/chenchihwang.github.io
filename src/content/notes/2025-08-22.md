spent another day rotting. locked in doing more menial shit. truthfully i shoulda done this all in the three days i had free time so that my transition back into school would act be smooth but well... alas.

schools about to start up again which will be really good for me. lets hit this semester really really fking hard. write good code everywhere i go.
