still got great sleep last night. forgot how late i slept. would be easier if i tracked it but lets go a week right now not worrying about the clock and see how that goes.

leaning heavily towards japan right now. lotta paper work to do tho.

fk getting kinda nervous cuz i planned out my courses poorly. now im left doing very little and thats getting me super nervous. like im not maximizing my decisions and my poor choices have caught up to me. fkk.

like listen to what kobe said about doubt. lets just not make any bad decisions and keep it pushing. dont care what other ppl think. i have too much self doubt. at some point this is all i ever wanted: to take it easy and recruit.

hella nervous but i think its fine to drop classes and focus on robotics or ai safety for now. get myself research. just keep trying. i can do that this sem, next sem i can keep up momentum and also get a slight breather doing classes elsewhere. man its scary as shit.

really tricky to fit everything in but imma need to do my best.

even if nothing is happening *right now* i need to remember that things will happen in the future as long as i work hard.
