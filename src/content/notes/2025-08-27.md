every night my sleep is good. good fking stuff. not been doing much but staying active and learning when i can. this allows me to hang out with people guilt free which is quite nice. 

fk dropped the ball a little. i should only be chilling at the end of the day. doing it midday makes you want to end early and chillax. so fking bad. dropped the ball a lot today, its okay matthew bailed me out and gave me hella good resources to apply to. but still i got bailed out yesterday. 

also wasn't locked in in classes at all. rn its so basic, and i feel like i haven't been challenged in a while.
