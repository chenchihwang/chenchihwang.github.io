first day i truly slipped. ~8 hrs of nothing today. full rot day and ruined my sleep schedule. holy. this is not good. lets pick it up.

lets keep my head up. learning is so much more fun than gaming. just run good music and learn. too fun man, didnt get algoverse full ride. its okay. keep the head up and apply to everything else. got some hmwrk done today but brain still operating super slow...
