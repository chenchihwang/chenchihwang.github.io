we gon need to lock the tf in today. also gotta drink more water. ok drank more water so thats good. lots of self torture by forcing myself to work. i dont think its gotta be like that tbh. being lazy legit just means you have nothing better to do. i have so many better things to do. so many things i want to get done.

ultimately i need to reduce the friction for me to get into a hardworking state. i can rot at night (not too much else i realize it jacks the dopamine state for the day after). i also need to pull an all nighter and be productive as i do so else bad things will percolate downwards. i also want to get the car in and fixed tomorrow.

lots of things to do. leave tomorrow mostly as a menial day to sort most things out. tonight is hmwrk. and monday is back to ai safety. ml cannot be this cancer so i dont need to fret too much.

just work hard. be a man i can be proud of. be a man i want the woman of my dreams to be proud of.
