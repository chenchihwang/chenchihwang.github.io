realitistically it is really really bad for my schedule fi i do the crbn apart hackathon this weekend, but i think i will just go for it. attending the discord was act quite motivating. also going to the trustworthy ai class was also super motivating. im super fkign lost but hte prof is so nice. i think this is motivating me less and less from going to japan this next winter.

need to get into mars 4.0 winter batch and without this apart hackathon i have zero shot. i really need to organize links for ai safety so i dont miss more shit 

recruitiung for this dumbass workshop in boston took much too much time. really poor use. should be able to pump these out in 30 min or less.
