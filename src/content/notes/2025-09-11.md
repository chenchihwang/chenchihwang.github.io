wow, for an onlooker reading my journal it act just looks like im the laziest, depressed fker. i think i need to drastically switch the connotation of my journal. report a good thing that happened everyday not just so it looks like im winning for randoms, but also so that i can see how i switched up to begin thinking more positively.

i want to see growth later when i look back on my journal.

lets get the wins for the last couple of days out actually:
- got into SPAR a coupla days ago. 
- refocused mental and want to all in on apart hackathon
- got into ai safety class at cmu
	- prof is really really nice so im excited to get taught by her
- casi looks really fun!
- finalized my schedule
- got groceries at whole foods, learned about harmful effects of seed oils + microplastics
- got my bike repaired
- got my car back

woah recording the dubs is so much healthier than logging the L's. i alr feel so happy and grateful.
