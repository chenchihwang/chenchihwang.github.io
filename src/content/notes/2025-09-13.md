yo sry guys, ima be completley honest. i appreciate everyone jumping on board on this hackathon with me. after starting, i realized that im wayy out my area of expertise here. i don’t have the  bandwidth or sufficient skill set to contribute meaningfully right now and I also don’t want to hold the team back. 

i have hella school work that ive put on the side for this hackathon, thats been stressing me out a lot on the side. i also haven't planned this out sufficiently enough so I wasn't able to delegate tasks efficiently, we haven't been communicating as much as desired, so i have no idea where we all are at, and we only have a day left. I've had a lot of shortcomings in leadership and planning, and I truthfully don't think I have the bandwidth to lock in and run this shit starting now for the next 24 hrs.

I'm so sorry for sending this in so late but i think it’s best if I step away so you all can take it forward without extra drag from me. I’m grateful you guys joined, I'm happy you guys believed in my idea, and I’m sorry I cant finish it out with you guys execution-wise. If there’s anything I can hand off to make the transition easier, I can do whatever. if you need a 5th, fate is maybe down to join i can ask him. sorry again guys.
