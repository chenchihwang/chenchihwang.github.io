didnt all nighter. got 5 hrs of sleep. goal is to finish spar, ml lecture, nap, then finish and submit cv hmwrk by 4. then can do mix of menial + leetcode + recruiting.

also note that waking up early feels fking amazing ! cold blue-ness of the morning is lit. took too many naps today most likley. at least i feel super fresh. would be amazing if i could get the 5 hr leetcode course done and then also check japan deadlines.

checked japan deadlines. still need to leetcode. overall productive, felt good, got a lot of things done, could be a lot better tho
