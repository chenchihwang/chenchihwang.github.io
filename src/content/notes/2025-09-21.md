did a quick review of the whole past week, lowk shit was pr subpar. i can do better. i am better than this.

ok spend today reprioritzing. i think main focuses are
1) getting sleep schedule back in shape
2) redailling my dopamine levels
3) leetcoding for meta oa
4) and doing ai safety hmwrk
5) doing spar
6) hitting most classes

talking with ppl feels empty, stuco felt empty, apricity felt empty. bike ride was good.
