i remember as a kid i would get food poisoning all the time and i would just sit on the toilet and take the L. shit would hurt so bad. i thought that was periodic, like its just a thing that happens to everyone.

turns out its just my dumbass parents always feeding me food thats half gone bad. ofc thats gonna happen. i only realized now that im in uni, that that doesn't happen to me anymore.

being afraid of failure results in a life with really low ev, feels rly good to put genuine effort in something you dont even know will work. this is good growth. and it comes with pressure from teammates which enables me to do this, else i might not have so this is good.
