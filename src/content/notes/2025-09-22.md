i remember as a kid i would get food poisoning all the time and i would just sit on the toilet and take the L. shit would hurt so bad. i thought that was periodic, like its just a thing that happens to everyone.

turns out its just my dumbass parents always feeding me food thats half gone bad. ofc thats gonna happen. i only realized now that im in uni, that that doesn't happen to me anymore.
