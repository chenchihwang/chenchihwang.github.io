fk. man im split between swe and ai safety research. i thought i was more sure of this. ah i did not lock in. not for cbrn not for acl submission. not even for SPAR. 

gotta show some more gumption than this. at this point its a bit too late. no ai safety proj done recently. just apply and see if i get next round. for now focus on leetcodes ig. if i get next rounds for these applications push out a solo project no matter what. also lock in on spar to increase my skillset.

nah im also getting hella motivated. always turn fear into excitement. HOW HYPE WOULD CAI AFRICA BE. focus man focus.
