think i fucked the cairf interview today. goddamnit. so fking sad. dont really have time to be too concerned tho im too busy for that shit. plus i could still pass this next round. just gotta make it to mentor matching

i rotted for like 2 hrs after i "bombed" the interview. a brief moment of weakness.

wish i could spend today just doing braindead menial stujff and then sleep early. if only life were that simple. 

also didn't completly cold shower today, started warm. couldn't bring myself to wake up while knowing i would need blast icy winter upon myself. did decrease temp throughout shower tho. will get on it tmrw adi
