lil jank sleep schedule now from teh past couple of days. funny how concerned i would be over ts in the past. now its just the move to keep it pushing.

wow, the 2.5 hrs of rotting ive done are much higher stakes now. i've made less time for my girl because of that shit. fking cooked. lock in me.

dont think im applying to the other two mentors for the future impact group. no bandwidth rn to do the apps. also need time to research for these apps. also feel like im going about this in the wrong way. need to upskill hella paper wise. goddamnit

i also need to be much more concerned about recruiting for swe jobs. i currently am unemployed right now. focus the hell up.
