ive been thinking in my head that this journal needs a turning point. ill do some visual change where is sort all the ones before this day in history and all the ones after in ssome way. i want the connotation to change - before often has me depressed and imposter syndroming but i want the after to one of growth and hard work. 

this is coming from a wake up call of what happened yesterday. i should be fresh on motivation but yesterday was still a moment of weakness.
