ive been thinking in my head that this journal needs a turning point. ill do some visual change where i sort all the entries before this day in history and all the ones after in ssome way. i want the connotation to change - before often has me depressed and imposter syndroming but i want the after to one of growth and hard work. 

like pre gf chen and post gf chen.

this is coming from a wake up call of what happened today and the last two days. i should be fresh on motivation but these days were still a moment of weakness. it wasnt completly rot, but overall poor.

keep telling myself to do better but talk is cheap. are actions are not. make her happy.
