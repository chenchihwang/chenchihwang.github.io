i suppose i did *technically* sleep as early as possible last night. yst was a weird case cuz of mars apps tho. still didnt do as well as i wanted to due to the last min nature and my prev procrastination, however its a good lesson learned and though i likely will not get this program, at least ill be more locked for cairf + interviews.

just woke up, planning rn, going to eat + watch lecture, then do ml assignment until i get restless and then go on campus immediately.

also going to start implementing two shower per day tech again. implement waking up and doing work immediately

felt extremely bad about only 1 submission to mars. cannot let the same feelings of regret bubble up for interview fully one week out. study study study.
