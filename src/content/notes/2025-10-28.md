today was pr busy so it felt pr good overall. ml hmwrk took me 11 hrs. this one was hella nontrivial ig. my dumbass thinking i could blitz it out in 4...

one thing to note is that im spending much too long waiting to fall asleep. if im not sleeping i need to be doing sm much more productive like LC or just getting some reading in. even if im exhausted from workign the whole day, i should not be wasting hours just waiting for sleep. on the plus side at least im not consuming media in the downtime.
