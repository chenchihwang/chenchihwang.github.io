i also feel like i should leave excerpts of writing that i like a lot here:

	In a culture where we are always striving to optimize it’s important to stop and consider which imperfections of ours are the things that define us. We don’t want to become the human equivalent of photorealist paintings. What flaws do we have that are actually the crackle of our record player or the grain of our film?
	
	That’s not to say we shouldn’t strive to improve but that improvement shouldn’t be a smoothing out. You may find yourself optimized but without any definition. Perfection isn’t really a defining characteristic. In many ways its the absence of them.
