additionally i just did a sort of year in review and looked at everything that happened from a weekly perspective. i truly have bummed it. just been bumming around. even for a majority of this semester too. i always say i want to change. always write abt it do, etc. lets actually change tho. the way it is now, if i let myself go to japan it'll be a disaster when im there anyways.

it would be really nice to be able to get a good year in, just be for the most part locked in. lets ask for smaller timescale first and try and manage for this next month.
