i think most important to my work ethic is figuring out exactly what it is I want. with that comes why i want it. the moment this is solved i should have no problems focusing. cant keep saying "gotta lock in" when idk what it is that im working for.

i think there's some argument to be made about letting it all go. ive been living under a huge amount of stress and im also scared to address it causing me to be in this state of misery

perhaps a good time to write up `limbo` essay....

had a good talk with matthew, back to being motivated again for the moment.
