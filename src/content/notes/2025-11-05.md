turned today 30m ago. only goal for today is 1) study for what i need to. 2) get sleep and 3) maintain good habits of water and posture etc. originally had a goal to rot less than 45 min. i already exceeded that, but i cannot omit that original goal just because i did not meet it.

just list down what needs to get done. i think last night sleep implementation was good. very fast and super exhausted. but in that case i needed more sleep - **solution**: sleep earlier and give myself  more hours of rest before needing to wake up. 

also want to get on campus asap.

thought back to middle / high school. i had so much potential. i wonder how i only ended up here / in this way. what ruined me? the internet in a way. i think i potentially always longed more for play, for the outdoors, for adventure. thats a tangent. i was relatively ahead in middle school. goddamnit.

i can still revert back to that, just need to also lock tf back in.

will be bad if take it easy the next coming week.
