lotta thoughts on how to get more social able. idk if this should be something that plagues my thoughts. i also believe strongly that you need to be a good person and want the best for others and just be thoughtful and things should work out. i will test strat **today**.

i think concrete things that are learnable are:
1) being more sociallable
2) gaining traits others have that i think are admirable
