yesterday was poor. **actionable items** include just sleeping and eating properly. 

woah today is poor too. man L after L. just got word from google i didnt pass their interview round. i should have expected this. i could've done a lot better in these interviews. the bar is a lot higher. 

1) i need to step up
2) it is time for some upskilling to occur
3) need to keep applying to various companies and use their interviews as practice

i think its a good decision to stay in pittsburgh if i havent another opportunity. this keeps options open for 
3) spring recruiting grind
4) working with phd's in random ass labs,
5) working with grey swan
6) i can take the easiest gen ed courses + idl

7) maybe masi 
8) maybe another mats pilot

summer:
3) surf for next summer given good research with aditi or begel or anyone else 
4) working with grey swan

ive went back and deleted some journal entries. i want each one to be meaningful and the ones where im drunk crying acting like im saying meaningful shit where im act just venting or saying nonsense - those entries have no real point.

goddamnit wasted another semester. feels rly bad actually. my life is a bit cooked rn. im not juggling anything else. my grades are looking bad, midterm went shit, last cv pset was turned in so poorly, will likely get a b in both classes. no internship,  no research fellowship, no projects. no social life.
