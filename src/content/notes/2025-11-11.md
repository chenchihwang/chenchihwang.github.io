i actually like: https://www.youtube.com/@escaping.ordinary a lot 

atomic habits notes:
1) must try to change identity itself, not processes nor outcomes
2) think about habit feedback loop

law 1 (make it obvious):
1) i will [behaviour] at [time] at this [location]
2) after [current habit] i will [new habit]
3) one space one use

law 2: make it attractive
1) temptation bundling - associate a habit we need to do with one we want to do
2) find groups to join where the habit you desire is the norm
3) think about where surface cravings manifest from  (the deeper underlying motives)
4) highlight positives of habits rather than negatives
5) break a bad habit by making it less attractive, make it as difficult as possible

law 3: make it easy
1) reduce friction to good habits
2) 2 min habit

law 3: make it satisfying
1) mismatch between immediate and long term with good and bad habits
	1) reward immediately for good habits (longer term) vice versa for bad
2) reward yourself and feeling progress
	1) use habit trackers, accountability partners, visual signals (marbles, paperclip)
3) on bad days, just show up regardless of any excuses.
4) break a bad habit 
	1) accountabiltily partners
	2) habit contracts

.... need to finish this ...
