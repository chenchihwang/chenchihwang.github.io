i definitely can say i tried today. was a long day. lot of things happened. not much went well. except for the truly easy ones like course reg and yapping with peter barnett. 

studying for era was a disaster, era interview was cooked, i did terribly in improv class. ml pset was a disaster - didnt get to empirical's. so badd. **solution:** is to get more sleep. focus on that tn.

next sem is just going to be rougher. simultaneously I need to focus on recruiting, research, and school. i suppose it will be a good exercise.
