grinded wpm for accuracy td. 62 100, 70 99, 75 99, 70 95. it feels like a waste of time but i dont think it actually was. that taught me to slow down when i type to make a greater effort to order the way i hit the characters. i can easily revert to the old way but i make many more typos. this is a step in the right direction!

finished aoi ashi today. dont aim for remote work this early. came to that conviction too. it is instead time to lock in.
