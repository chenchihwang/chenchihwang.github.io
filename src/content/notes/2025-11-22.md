yst was poor. td was poor as well.

some random thoughts i had:
- took a super optimal break to cook and also look into uk travel. that was done well. jetpac for esim in uk is fine. gifffgaff is better
	- https://www.giffgaff.com/sim-only-deals/pay-as-you-go
- after the rain is such a cute manga. artist act had to lock in to make the premise cute.
- naming my future dog mogu. such a cute name
- i run my blog much like what i would post on twitter (can def see how the idea came about)
