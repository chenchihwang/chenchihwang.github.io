woah, ik i said i would stop journalling (publicly), but damn my sleep is reset, im waking up and feeling too good about today. most dark thoughts gone, sunlight and normal sleep cured it all. 

- i think i will still do lil snippets here but keep them small and keep them personal. do my best to document the wins no matter how small. if notes become less frequent so be it. all other trivial notes go on x.

call with sk last night. was a decent wake up call. this is not the man i want to be for her. shes locked in, focused on improving herself. im not. i can already see problems down the line if not now. tbh i see problems now already. this on me.

woke up and scrolled twitter insta. gotta make sure im checking following over for you. still hella good vibes. implementing this act feels rly good.
