woah, ik i said i would stop journalling (publicly), but damn my sleep is reset, im waking up and feeling too good about today. most dark thoughts gone, sunlight and normal sleep cured it all

call with sk last night. was a decent wake up call. this is not the man i want to be for her. shes locked in, focused on improving herself. im not. i can already see problems down the line if not now. tbh i see problems now already. this one me.

woke up and scrolled twitter insta. gotta make sure im checking following over for you. still hella good vibes. implementing this act feels rly good.

every waking hour is a working hour.
