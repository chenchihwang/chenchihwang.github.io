lets record every moment of my life in the calendar this year. lets also record all the high and low points this year as well. would like a nice template but not sure how to go about this as of yet. i think i want to build out khronos pr soon. im also inclined to create a habit tracker in that as well to get public visibility / pressure.

i also think it would be quite nice to record the highs and lows for all days of the year to be able to plug it into some chat bot to get me a year in recap. seems optimal.

high:
- got amazon offer for 26 sum
- got idea to track highs and lows for yearly recap. may want to create this as as service, simple web app.

low:
