idk how to feel. just watched fight club and the film itself felt pr good. felt like i saw a man going through midlife crisis. thats what i feel right now. my life is spiralling right now. idk what im doing.

i cannot drag her down w me. i cannot

i think its fine to have some days i crash out. not putting it in the journal is making me panic more. 

need to make her happy
