applied to some jobs. i think recruiting is largely not useful in the way that i just spam apply. lowkey bombed my india through film report. feels bad. fk one more thing to worry about.

ok lets set myself up to be hella high agency for the rest of the year .

if i can finish my backlog and also fix my sleep schedule by end of week ill be really happy. if i can also set myself up to be exercising 5/7 days of the week that would be great too. show up for myself.
