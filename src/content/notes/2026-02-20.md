warm weather, open curtains, good wind - first time feeling lucid in a while. 7:24 pm, warm lights from the lamp behind me, speaker playing soft tunes ...

forget knee high, I'm chest high in school work at the moment. this is not who I want to be. I know that yet its so so hard for me to change.  

I've become so scared of showing who I am. there's this toxic negative feedback loop. i am not proud of who i am so i fear showing myself, meeting new people, etc. 

fk it. if you're here and reading this then you get a raw dosage of all my baggage. unlucky bro. alt tab now if you tryna dodge negative vibes, but at this point id rather spill it all out than be too scared to admit it.

im a bum. truly i believe that. thats a terrible spot to be in. i know the only reasonable thing to do from here is lock in until i dont feel this way again.

this will entail:
1) meeting and making meaningful connections
2) getting my work in (on time)
	1) going to classes
	2) doing hmwrk
	3) applying to jobs, reaching out to recruiters
3) learning
