ive been going through a lot of thoughts. been going through a slump. as i write this I think i understand more and more why.

theres been a shift of priorities recently. ive surrounded myself with the most passionate of people at CMU, hoping to be changed, to come out stronger.

what i wanted happened. they've changed me. at the same time it's intimidating, truly. 

I thought i was like this, this passionate. maybe at some point I was. but i lost follow-through. whereas these people pulled through. thats big. its not easy to do that. I know, cuz I tried. Or maybe I was just weak, idk. 

change is always scary, comfort is always preferred, thats the human condition. thats why its kinda low-key scary for me to feel like a part of apricity, one) because these are all amazing humans who pushed past the fear that haunts me so dearly and two) because I'm afraid to all in and push myself seriously. 

I genuinely want to upskill myself. ive been reading a manga called blue box and the characters were able to love themselves and others, because they had the confidence in themselves stemming from the genuine effort they put in. 

I'm very aware I'm the same. It's hard to love myself while feeling like I could be doing more. Even harder it is to love others. I want to be someone who can love others.

ik what i want to do, but im scared of what ill become. im also scared of the work, scared of what ill lose. scared of how hard it might be. 

I think im really close though, I'm at a tipping point. I'm at a point where i have to make a decision, one that will dictate if i grow and reach the heavens or if i stay where i am and remain complacent. 

I think I've been at these crossroads so many times. 

maybe I've never been disgusted enough to be willing to viscerally and maliciously kill who I am. just never had the courage to pull the trigger

im low-key so fed up though. 

so disappointed with myself for not doing this sooner.

for remaining weak like this.

this has already been in the process of happening, so now I iterate concretely:

#### what I stand to gain:

- recovery of my self image
- self confidence => happiness
	- can hold my head high
	- can finally pursue a woman only after i find happiness internally
- strength
	- agency
#### here's what I need to be willing to lose:

what I've already lost:
- possibly my friends

what its going to cost:
- my old life
	- my comfort
	- my free time
	- my options to make bad decisions

what i need to change:
- my apathy
	- my willingness / ok-ness to be mid
- motivation / work ethic
	- need to explore in a way that makes me fall in love with it
- fear
	- my fear of being wanting to be stronger is so high bcz:
		- of the barrier to asking questions (dont wanna seem stupid)
		- so uncomfortable admitting that i need improvement
		- scary to consider what happens if i try my best and im still mid?

im willing to kill me for this.
